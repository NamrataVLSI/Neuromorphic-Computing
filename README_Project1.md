## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The project involves performing MOSFET simulations using **Cadence Virtuoso** and analyzing the results in **MATLAB** and/or through hand calculations:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

Instructions for exporting simulation data:  
- Save a waveform from your Volta account as a `.csv` file: **Right-click â†’ Send To â†’ Exportâ€¦**  
- Transfer the `.csv` files from Volta to your computer using **WinSCP**.

## ðŸ§ª Analysis 1: Channel-length Dependence of the Early Voltage (Strong Inversion)

1. For an **nMOS**, perform an **IDS vs VDS sweep** at **VGS = 1 V** for (W/L) = (1/1) with channel lengths:  
L = [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50] Î¼m
2. Calculate the **output resistance (ro)** in the saturation region for each case.  
3. Extract the **Early voltage (VA)** using:  
ro = VA / IDS

and plot **VA vs L**.  
4. Comment on the results.

## ðŸ§® Analysis 2: Extracting Îº (Kappa) in Weak Inversion (Subthreshold)

1. Propose **two methods** to determine the **kappa (Îº)** value of an nMOS with:  
W = [6, 12, 18, 24] Î¼m
L = 6 Î¼m

2. For each method:  
- Design the schematic setups and perform the required simulations.  
- Conduct the analysis (hand calculations and/or MATLAB) to extract Îº.  

3. Compare the Îº values obtained by both methods.
